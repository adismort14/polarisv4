                            <li class="info__item">Maths: It is a natural tendency of most students after coming to IIT to neglect maths. DON’T do it! In CSE we can see the result of our programming is on screen. And in Mechanical Engineering whatever is happening we can see it physically e.g. by applying force, weighing it etc. But in EE we can’t. First, we need to MODEL IT in MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS and then see, what is the output for input. So, topics in maths like Vector Calculus, Fourier and Laplace transforms, Differential Equations, Matrix Analysis are very important. Don’t detest these subjects.</li>

                    <p class="intro-me__text">Have you ever wondered how rockets and flights are manoeuvred? Does the flourishing sound of an engine and manufacturing processes tingle your curiosity? Then this field is for you. You will get a boost to your mechanics, statics, solid and fluid dynamics knowledge and you will surely enjoy all of it, you’ll also learn how mechanical structures are supported, automation and robotics, workshops (e.g. welding, lathing) and their applications.</p><br>

                    <p class="intro-me__text">Mechanical Engineering basically deals with the following domains:</p>

                    <ul class="info__list">
                        <li class="info__item">Design</li>

                        <li class="info__item">Manufacturing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="intro-me__text">During the course you will learn and explore basic sciences behind the mechanical systems we see using the tools of physics. You will also learn to fabricate objects using different manufacturing process that includes moulding, 3D printing, Laser Cutting etc.</p> <br>
