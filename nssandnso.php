                                              We are a group of students who believe in building a better society. Working passionately towards this vision, we conduct simple yet effective voluntary activities that serve the society. It also helps students develop personality through community service. NSS at IIT Bhilai provides a platform for interaction between students and the population near IIT Bhilai where they can present their ideas for social welfare in less developed communities.
                                              The activites mentioned in the throwback video are held by NSS at regular intervals.
